# Bedrock-Edition-Map-Art-Maker
For Making Map Art in Minecraft Bedrock Edition

Run program using a javafx ide and then type the image location into the text box on the app. Then select your algorithm method and watch your map be converted to Minecraft Bedrock map art.

Do not copy this repository because nothing will happen. I did not create any dependencies and files that can help run the program quickly. Instead copy the java classes individually and to the right spots. (You need to know how JavaFX works in order to do this)
